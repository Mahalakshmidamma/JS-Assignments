     Story of Seasons, known in Japan as Bokuj≈ç Monogatari[a] and formerly known
     as Harvest Moon, is an agricultural simulation role-playing video game 
    series created by Yasuhiro Wada and developed by Victor Interactive Software
    (acquired by Marvelous Entertainment in 2003, now Marvelous Inc.). 
     Story of Seasons was the first game to be released under the new 
     international series title of the same name.

    The main objective of the series is to rebuild a dilapidated old farm 
    and turn it into a successful one. Over a period of time, the player tends 
    to crops and livestock, befriends nearby townsfolk, and eventually marries
    and starts a family. The first game in the series, Harvest Moon, was 
    released for the Super NES in 1996.
